Stock price prediction app using LSTM Model
I have used an open source app framework called Streamlit, to create an interactive application which can help predict the price of stock with the help of technical analysis.
In this project the basic analysis revolves around two indicators, namely the 100 moving average and 200 moving average, both of them can be used combinely to predict the prices of stocks in long terms with
high accuracy.
